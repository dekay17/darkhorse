<h2>1. Overview</h2>

<p>The Lavahound Web site and Mobile Application (&quot;Lavahound&quot;, &quot;we,&quot; or &quot;us&quot;) is a community
site containing user-generated photos, maps and information for things and places worldwide
(collectively, the &quot;Services&quot;). We at Lavahound recognize that your privacy is important to you.
We have created this privacy policy (&quot;Privacy Policy&quot;) to explain our privacy practices so you
will understand when and how personally identifiable information is collected, used, disclosed
and protected with respect to our website and our Mobile Application. By accessing our site,
you consent to our privacy policy as described herein.</p>

<h2>2. What kind of information does Lavahound collect about you?</h2>

<p>We collect two basic types of information from our Site and Mobile Application. Personally
identifiable information is information that is directly associated with a specific person or entity
such as a user&#39;s name, e-mail address, or information about activities that is directly linked to that
person.</p>

<p>Our definition of personally identifiable information does not include &quot;aggregate&quot; information.
Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or user from
which individual user identities have been removed. Aggregate data may include anonymous
demographic information such as country of origin, citizenship, ZIP code, age, gender,
preferences and survey information. In other words, how you use our Site and Mobile
Application may be collected and combined with information about how others use the Site
and Mobile Application, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data.
Aggregate data helps us deliver new features or otherwise tailor our Site and Mobile Application.</p>

<p>The choice of how much personally identifiable information you disclose to us is completely
at your discretion. Some areas of our Site and Mobile Application are accessible without
registration of any kind, and you can browse those areas of our Site. Other areas of our Site
require registration in order for you to participate in the services offered. It is not mandatory
for you to register and provide information to us, but please realize that in order for us to serve
you better or provide particular features, you will need to provide certain information to access
some areas of our Site. We collect information you give us when you register at and use our Site.
Specific examples of the information we collect include the following:</p>

<p>A. Registration Information. When you register at our Site and Mobile Application, we may
collect various kinds of contact information about you including your name, e-mail address, date
of birth, and other personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>B. Lavahound Profile, Postings and Comments. Please note that information and content that
you post on our Site and Mobile Application by using our services including, but not limited
to, locations, reviews, and photos as well as your screen ID and information in your Lavahound
profile can be viewed by the general public, and also may be stored on our systems indefinitely.
You should not post any personally identifiable information that you do not wish to make
publicly available.</p>

<p>C. Submissions and Customer Service. From time-to-time we may post surveys, contests or
sweepstakes on our site and Mobile Application, which may request personally identifiable
information, demographic information and/or customer feedback. Contests may require contact
information or other demographic or personally identifiable information in order to determine
eligibility. We may use information collected from surveys and contests to notify and contact
winners of those contests. Participation in these requests is completely voluntary and with each
request you will have the choice of whether or not to participate and disclose information. Also,
we may collect information that identifies you personally when you send us comments, questions
or suggestions.</p>

<p>D. Cookies and Passive Data Collection. We automatically receive certain types of information
whenever you interact with our Site and Mobile Application. For example, when you visit the
Site, our systems automatically collect standard user information and clickstream data for all
users, including a user&#39;s IP address, operating system, and page views. Information may be
automatically collected through the use of &quot;cookies&quot; which are discussed in more detail below.
Cookies are small text files placed on your hard drive by a web site when you visit. These files
identify your computer and record your preferences and other data about your visit so that when
you return to the site, the site knows who you are and can personalize your visit. In general, we
may use cookies to collect information so that we can determine how to improve our site by
seeing which areas and features are most popular, to personalize the site and improve the site
experience. Cookies are not tied to your personally identifiable information. Most browsers
automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies
or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser options.
If you decide not to accept our cookies, you will still be able to access those parts of our site
available to the general public but you may not be able to use some of the site&#39;s features or
services and you may have a less satisfactory experience.</p>

<p>E. Third Party Links and Ad Servers. We may provide links to third party websites, which
may, or may not, use cookies, pixel tags and web tags. We also allow other companies, called
third-party ad servers, to display advertisements on Lavahound.com. Ad servers may also use
these tools to compile information about where users saw particular advertisements, and to
determine which ads were clicked on. We are not responsible for, or have any control over, the
privacy policies of those third party websites and ad servers, and encourage all users to read the
privacy policies of each and every website visited when linking directly from Lavahound.</p>

<h2>3. How will the information that Lavahound collects be used?</h2>

<p>In general, we use personal information to serve our users, enable them to take maximum
advantage of our services and to improve the products and services we provide to you. For
example, we may use personal information to contact our users relating to their registration to
our service, to anticipate and resolve problems with our Site and Mobile Application, to respond
to customer support inquiries, and to send other Lavahound administrative and systems-related
messages. We reserve the right to send such communications to our users without offering the

Policy until such time as it was amended in accordance with the process for modification
set forth herein.</li>

<li>If Lavahound is ever merged with another company, or if Lavahound buys, sells or
reorganizes some or all part(s) of its business, parties involved in such a transaction
would gain access to the information that Lavahound has collected over time. Such third
parties would be required, however, to adhere to the provisions of this Privacy Policy
until such time as it was amended in accordance with the process for modification set
forth herein</li>

<h2>5.  What are the opt-out choices Lavahound provides you with regarding the
collection, use, and distribution of your information?</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your registration with
our service and Lavahound&#39;s other services, such as customer service responses and other
administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them. You
can opt-out from receiving such messages by canceling your registration with Lavahound. We
reserve the right to send you advertisements, newsletters, and any other commercial solicitations
to our users. You can opt-out from receiving this kind of communication in your profile settings.</p>

<p>Third parties may independently collect information about users when users choose to view
links or ads displayed on Lavahound. Users should contact those third parties directly if they
do not wish to receive communications from them, or do not want those third parties to collect
information about them.</p>

<p>We are opposed to spam and our Terms of Service expressly prohibit users from uploading,
posting, emailing, transmitting or otherwise making available junk mail, commercial
advertisements, or other form of commercial solicitation on the Lavahound website or through
Lavahound&#39;s services. Any violation of our policies, by sending unsolicited email advertisements
to or through Lavahound&#39;s computer systems, will result in the sender being blocked from use
of the Site and Mobile Application and may subject the sender and his or her agents to civil and
criminal penalties.</p>

<h2>6. What security procedures does Lavahound use to protect against the loss,
misuse, or alteration of information collected by the company?</h2>

<p>Lavahound uses industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of
the information under our control. Although we make good faith efforts to store the information
collected by the Lavahound website and Mobile Application in a secure operating environment
that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee complete security. Further, while we
make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot
guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party &quot;hackers&quot; from illegally obtaining
this information.</p>

<p>Your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password. To protect
the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not
disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of our web site by any person
using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been
misused.</p>
